# Route Optimization project for delivery people

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a system that optimizes postal delivery routes using Artificial Intelligence. The system will perform an analysis of all delivery points, generating specialized routes for each motorcycle courier based on products and addresses. In this way, we seek to reduce delivery routes and avoid repeat deliveries in areas with a high concentration of orders, improving logistical efficiency and promoting a more agile and economical service.
